     The following are a list of the changes that have been made to the STEVIE
(vi clone) text editor between version 3.87 and the 3.90:

     1)  The source code for wrapmargin and the ^W erase-word functions were
cleaned up to be more modular.  This improvement is not visible from within the
STeVIe program.

     2)  The "set lines=" command has been modified to prevent Atari ST owners
from selecting a value larger than 25.  Displaying more than 25 lines did not
work properly under any resolution monitor.  (If anybody can explain how to get
50 lines on a monochrome monitor, I'll correct this option.)

     3)  Function key mapping implemented!  The function keys, both shifted and
non-shifted, now can be programmed for command macros.

     4)  The STEVIE.INF configuration file may now contain function key macro
mappings!

     5)  Rewrote the mark functions, so that all 26 marks (a-z) may now be 
used.  Searching for the mark now uses an efficient array lookup scheme.


FUTURE PLANS FOR THE STEVIE EDITOR:

     Permit 50-lines of text to be displayed on monochrome.  (Provided that
somebody will send me mail to explain how to do it!)

     Just remember, I've only added to the great amount of work performed by
Tony Andrews.  However, I will be willing to examine bugs related to the
features listed above and within the STVI381.DOC and STVI387.DOC files.
