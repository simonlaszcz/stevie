     The following are a list of the changes that have been made to the STEVIE
(vi clone) text editor between version 3.81 and the 3.87:

      1)  A new "set" command option has been added, aitabs.  Aitabs is a
boolean option, with a default value of true.  Aitabs forces the autoindenting
function to pad as much white space as is possible with tab characters.  This
is the normal method that the VI text editor uses to perform autoindenting.  
If you do not want tab characters to be used during autoindenting (space 
characters are used instead), then execute the command "set noaitabs".  Please
note that this option is not available with the genuine VI text editor!

      2)  Another new "set" command option was added:  wrapmargin.  Wrapmargin
is standard in VI.  It is use to automatically insert new lines at a convenient
location between words, and it will enforce a right margin of a user-determined
size.

      3)  Autoindenting was fixed in several ways.  When inserting a carriage
return in the middle of a line of text, the new line will now indent.  The
indenting command ^T has been fixed to properly set the autoindent buffer.

      4)  A very serious bug has been eliminated.  The editor used to crash,
if the very first '/' or '?' search command was executed without any search
string (just a carriage return).

      5)  The delete last-typed word command ^W has been implemented.  This
command only works within insert mode, and only within the current line.

      6)  The "help" feature has been reorganized and expanded to explain
almost all of the commands.
