     The following are a list of the changes that have been made to the STEVIE
(vi clone) text editor between version 3.69 and the current 3.81:

      1)  A new "set" command option has been added, shiftwidth.  Shiftwidth
requires a numeric value.  It becomes the size that is used for all shifting
operations: ^D, ^T (insert mode), <, and > (command mode).  The default value
is shiftwidth=8.

      2) Autoindenting has been cleaned up.  The autoindenting feature no
longer duplicates the white space that begins the preceding line character by
character.  It calculates the size of the preceding white space, and pads the
new line with tabs before using space characters.  This is a more efficient
use of the line buffers, and is actually the way "vi" implements autoindenting.

      3)  The shift operators ^D, ^T, >, and < no longer insert or delete tabs
from the beginning of lines.  The amount of white space is calculated, before
shiftwidth amount of space is added or deleted.  A side effect of the shifting
operators is that the white space is recalculated and padded with tabs before
using any space characters.

      4)  During insert mode, control characters cannot be accidently entered
into the text.  Before any text is inserted it is examined to see if it is a
printing character.  Only the following control characters have meaning during
insert mode:  NL, CR, TAB, ESC, ^I (same as tab), ^D, ^T, BS, and ^V.

      5)  In order to quote control characters during insert mode, use the
^V (control-V) command.  This is a feature of "vi", and must be immediately 
followed by a single character that is to be embedded into the file.  Any 
character that has a decimal value less than 127 (with the exception of null 
characters - value 0) can be embedded into the file.

      6)  When files are written, the correct number of characters is now
reported.  The total number did not properly reflect whether or not the return
option was "set" or disabled.

      7)  Files can now be zero bytes, if desired.  Likewise, the last line of
text does not have to be followed by a linefeed.  However, if you want the last
line to be terminated by a linefeed, the file must end with an empty line.
Every time a new line is entered, it forces a linefeed to the previous line.
This isn't too bad of an idea, after all, that is how a typewriter works.

      8)  During command mode, the "Q" command is now synonymous with the ":"
command.  This was an easy way to implement the quit command from "vi".  Note
that the "Q" is capitalized!

      9)  The } and { commands have been implemented to search forward "}" and
backward "{" for the next or previous paragraph.  A paragraph is defined a
series of non-white text line(s) that are separated by empty lines or lines
that just contain white space (tabs and spaces) only.

     10)  The ) and ( commands have been implemented to search forward ")" and
backward "(" for the next or previous sentence.  A sentence ends with a period
".", exclamation "!", or question "?" mark and is followed by two spaces or a
linefeed.  While looking for sentences, the following characters in the text
file are ignored: (, ), [, ], ', and " (parentheses, brackets, and quotes).

     11)  A configuration file can be used to initialize all of the desired
"set" commands.  A configuration file must exist in the default directory, and
must either be named "STEVIE.INF" or "VI.INF".  If both files exist, then only
"STEVIE.INF" will be read in and used.  All text lines that appear in the
configuration file are passed on to the function that executes the colon prompt
commands.  The primary use of the configuration file is to initialize all of
the "set" options.  An example content of the "STEVIE.INF" file is:

     set ai mo
     set shiftwidth=4

When the "map" command is finally implemented, function key mappings will also
be able to appear in the configuration file.
